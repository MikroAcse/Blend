# Blend
Blend is an Android puzzle game focused on color mixing.
Made with LibGDX.

The main feature of this game is that animation must look cool (which it does, I hope).

Sadly, abandoned.

## Implemented features
  - Asset and config loading/parsing via custom AssetManager;
  - Language bundles;
  - Animated working prototype of UI;
  - Can't remember, I worked on this a long time ago ;)
